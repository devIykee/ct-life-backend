# Changelog

> Every change to the contract, in the order it is signed. Both teams read this before upgrading.

The contract is the OpenAPI spec, the Colyseus schemas, the ID registries, the config files and the Anchor IDL. A change is **additive** if the new field is optional, the new error code is new, the new message is new, or the new enum value is new. Anything else is a **breaking** change.

## 1.0.0-rc1

The first release candidate. Establishes the contract surface that the Unity client (FE) and the backend (BE) code against.

### Additive

- **`SERVER_BUSY` error code.** New error returned when the global login-concurrency limiter, the per-IP limiter, or any saturated dependency returns. HTTP `503` with a `Retry-After` header. The frontend builds a "city is busy, retrying" screen. (See `contract/ids/errors.json` and `contract/openapi.yaml`.)
- **`degraded: string[]` field on `GET /v1/config`.** A list of feature flags currently in degraded mode (e.g. `["voice", "llm", "feed"]`). The frontend reads it and disables those surfaces.
- **Multi-process realtime sharding (M3).** Multiple realtime processes, multiple `market` rooms fed by a single market leader via Redis pub/sub. The contract still says "market" room; the implementation sharded behind it. The frontend is unchanged.

### Breaking

- None.

## Unreleased

### Additive (FE-owned registries)

- **`ids/anims.json` 1.1.0:** 40 new animation IDs (sitting, phone, talk, dance, despair, liquidation set, tribe emotes, and `act_host_mic`, `act_listen_nod`, `emote_moon_jump`, `react_sad`). No renames or removals.
- **`ids/sfx.json` 1.1.0:** 34 new `sfx_*` IDs (UI, trading, stingers, phone, voice rooms, ORE refinery). No renames or removals.
- **`ids/spots.json` 1.1.0:** 22 venues (was 7) and 222 spots (was 38). Every existing spot ID is kept. Spots now carry `x`, `z`, `rotY` in metres/radians, and walkable rectangles match the FE greybox scenes.
